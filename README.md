# PDF_FixHairlines
Python 3 tool to decompress PDF file(s), parse for thin line weights in binary, resize these, and recompress.  

Useful for fixing "hairlines" (zero-weight lines, one pixel wide at all resolutions) and barely-visible thin lines.  Tested on Win/Linux, needs [GhostScript](https://www.ghostscript.com/download.html) for compression routines.
